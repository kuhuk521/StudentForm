Student form using JSON Power DB

**Title of the Project** - Student enrollment form using JSON Power DB

**Description** - This form stores the student's enrollment number, name, class, address, enrollment date and birth date. The enrollment number is used as a primary key

**Benefits of using JsonPowerDB** - JSON Power DB (JPDB) is a real-time, high-performance, and lightweight database. It's a multi-mode DBMS that supports JSON documents, key-value pairs, and RDBMS. Here are some benefits of using JSON Power DB:
1. Schema-free: Easy to maintain
2. Serverless support: Fast development and reduced time to market
3. Webservices API: Low development cost
4. Multiple security layers: One of the fastest and most secure databases
5. Inbuilt support for querying multiple databases: Can more rapidly meet new data structure requirements
6. Serverside Native NoSQL: Best performance
7. Built around the world's fastest indexing engine: PowerIndex
8. Ready to use API: For JSON document DB, RDBMS, key-value DB, GeoSpatial DB, and Time Series DB functionality
9. Simple to use: Ajax-enabled, and doesn't require any server-side programming or scripting
